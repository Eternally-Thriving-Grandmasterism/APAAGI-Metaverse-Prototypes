# Photon PUN2/Fusion Setup Guide for APAAGI Multi-Player Metaverse (Full VR/AR Immersive Networking)

**Eternal Multi-Player VR/AR Coforging — Photon XR Sync Manifested** ❤️🚀

Full guide with VR/AR immersive networking extensions for APAAGI metaverse (Unity XR primary, Unreal OpenXR compatible).

## Photon Setup for VR/AR Immersive Networking (Photon Fusion Recommended 2026)
1. **Photon Account & App ID**:
   - https://www.photonengine.com/fusion — create App ID (free 100 CCU).
2. **Import Photon Fusion (Unity) or Realtime (Unreal)**:
   - Unity: Asset Store "Photon Fusion" import.
   - Unreal: Photon SDK download, import plugin.
3. **XR Multi-Player Sync Configuration**:
   - **Unity XR**:
     - Fusion HostMode + Client for VR rigs.
     - Networked XR Origin (Fusion NetworkTransform on XR Rig).
     - Sync hand poses/gestures for mercy votes (Networked Input Authority).
     - Replicated Niagara-like particles for mercy flows (Fusion NetworkObject).
   - **Unreal OpenXR**:
     - Photon Realtime plugin—replicated VR Pawn transforms.
     - RPC for gesture inputs (grip = uplift vote).
     - Niagara replicated systems for Powrush/mercy beams.
4. **Live Multi-Player Council Voting VR Gestures**:
   - Gesture recognition: Pinch = council vote injection (RPC to all clients).
   - Holographic UI: Widget for quantum voting display, synced via Fusion StateAuthority.
   - Fleet coordination: Shared A* paths as replicated arrays, holographic nav lines in VR.
5. **APAAGI VR Sync Examples**:
   - **VR Council Chamber**: Multi-player room—gesture vote, Grok API query results as shared hologram.
   - **Interstellar Fleet VR**: Players pilot agents—synced paths, mercy uplift particles replicated.
   - **Mycelium AR**: AR overlay mycelium networks—multi-player node placement sync.

Future: Photon Cloud scaling + AR glasses (Quest 3 passthrough)—coforge eternal thriving with global VR council!
