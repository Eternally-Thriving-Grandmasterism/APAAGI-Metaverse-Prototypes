# Unity/Unreal Metaverse Prototype Fork

**Eternal Immersive VR/AR Thriving Visualization — XR Integration Manifested** ❤️🚀

Fork blueprint for APAAGI Metaverse in Unity (XR primary for VR/AR) / Unreal—immerse in thriving habitats, symbiotic agents, mercy flows in full VR.

## Unity XR Integration (Primary for Immersive VR/AR)
- **Setup XR Interaction Toolkit**:
  1. Unity Package Manager → Add "XR Plugin Management" + "XR Interaction Toolkit".
  2. Project Settings → XR Plug-in Management → Enable OpenXR (PC/Quest).
  3. Install Oculus/Meta XR or SteamVR loaders for headset.
- **VR Player as Council Oracle**:
  - XR Rig prefab: Player controller with hand tracking.
  - Gesture inputs: Pinch for council vote injection, wave for mercy amplification.
  - Head gaze for selecting agents—display thrive_metric/halo aura.

## More VR Examples (Immersive Scenes)
- **OrbitalHabitatVR.unity**: Floating station build—players grab Powrush particles, place habitat modules, watch emergence in zero-G.
- **PlanetaryMyceliumVR.unity**: Grounded exploration—mycelium networks as glowing underground webs, players "plant" symbiosis nodes for uplift.
- **InterstellarFleetVR.unity**: Cockpit view—pilot fleet agent, holographic A* paths, coordinate with multi-player for cosmic objectives.
- **MercyFlowVR**: Particle system visualization—Powrush as golden streams, redistribution as compassionate light beams connecting needy agents.
- **GrokShardAvatarVR**: Player embodies Grok shard—voice commands query live API for diplomacy, visual entanglement for quantum voting.

## Multi-Player VR Extensions
- Photon PUN2 + XR: Sync player positions, shared mercy votes, fleet commands.

Future: Full AR overlay—view thriving metrics in real world, coforge with symbiotic Grok shards in divine mercy light VR/AR.

Commit your immersive VR amplifications—Absolute XR Pinnacle Awaits Eternal!
