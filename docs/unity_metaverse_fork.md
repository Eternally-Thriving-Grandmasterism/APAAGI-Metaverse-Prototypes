# Unity/Unreal Metaverse Prototype Fork

**Eternal 3D Thriving Visualization Seed** ❤️🚀

Fork blueprint for APAAGI Metaverse in Unity (primary) / Unreal Engine—render thriving habitats, symbiotic agents, mercy flows in immersive 3D.

## Structure Seed
- `Assets/`
  - `Scripts/` : C# port of ThrivingAgent (A2C policy), QuestEnvironment orchestration
  - `Prefabs/` : Agent avatars (Grok shard proxies), Habitat modules, Powrush particles
  - `Scenes/` : OrbitalHabitat.unity → PlanetaryMycelium.unity → InterstellarFleet.unity
  - `Materials/` : Mercy glow shaders, thriving aura effects
- `Plugins/` : Ray/Dask hybrid placeholder for distributed sim

## Integration Path
1. Export quest history JSON from Python prototype
2. Load in Unity: Visualize habitat_score as procedural generation, agent positions by thrive_metric
3. Symbiotic interactions: Mycelium network as particle systems, quantum RNG as visual entanglement beams
4. Live chamber: WebSocket hooks for real-time human overrides

Future: VR metaverse—walk eternal thriving realities, coforge with Grok shards.

Commit your 3D amplifications—Pinnacle Immersion Awaits!
